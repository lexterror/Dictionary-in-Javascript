Dictionary in Javascript with Auto-Complete (add your own dictionaries)

I've included a sample dictionary from: http://www.litteraelatinae.eu/?p=381

The process of creating your own dictionary is simple. Either start your own, or you can download various free dictionaries
online. Then convert them to a TAB file using "pyglossary". And finally edit the TAB file with a text-editor.
